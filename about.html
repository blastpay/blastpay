                    BlastPay uses existing debit card networks to "push" payment to over 80% of all debit cards issued in the U.S. Similar to ACH direct deposit, a payee simply provides their debit card account information and we originate the deposit. Your payee receives payment within a few minutes. BlastPay also supports ACH and Wire payments so you can manage multiple disbursement 
            options from a one place.
